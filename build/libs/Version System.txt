The_Fireplace:
This is the versioning system I use for all of my mods. Here is how the system works:
Version X.Y.Z.A
X = The major Minecraft version the build is for. My mods use 1.7.10 as 1, and 1.8 as 2.
Y = The content release of the mod. Basically, if an update contains new content, such as blocks, items, mobs, or major internal changes, this number will increase.
Z = The internal version of the mod. When this number increases, it contains bugfixes or minor internal changes. If this number is 0, it is not considered a stable release, but a beta build of that content version. 1 is considered the first stable build of the version.
A = This will only be above 0 on the beta versions. It is the beta build number.

Backport versions:
If requested, I will make a backport version of a mod. Their versions will look like this:
Version bpW(X.Y.Z.A)
bp stands for backport
W = The version of minecraft being backported to. Will be a full version number, such as 1.7.10 or 1.6.2.
X.Y.Z.A = The version of the mod it was backported from.

Changelogs will be done on full releases, and sometimes on the beta builds.

This information should always be up to date, but in case it isn't, here is the thread: http://thefireplace.clanwebsite.com/210538/topic/my-mod-versioning-system-v28
