The_Fireplace:
This is the versioning system I use for all of my mods. Here is how the system works:
Version X.Y.Z.A
X = The major Minecraft version the build is for. My mods use 1.7.10 as 1, 1.8 as 2, and 1.8.8 as 3.
Y = The content release of the mod. Basically, if an update contains new content, such as blocks, items, mobs, or major internal changes, this number will increase.
Z = The internal version of the mod. When this number increases, it contains bugfixes or minor internal changes.
A = This will only be above 0 on builds made using Jenkins. It is he build number.

Backport versions:
If requested, I will make a backport version of a mod. Their versions will look like this:
Version bpW(X.Y.Z.A)
bp stands for backport
W = The version of minecraft being backported to. Will be a full version number, such as 1.7.10 or 1.6.2.
X.Y.Z.A = The version of the mod it was backported from.
